          <h1>Problem Description</h1>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">
              The analogy is based upon a hypothetical barber shop with one barber and chair and n waiting chairs.
              If there is no customer, then the barber sleeps in his own chair.
              When a customer arrives, they wake up the barber.
              If there are many customers and the barber is cutting a customerâ€™s hair, then the remaining customers either wait if there are empty chairs, or they leave.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h1>Solution</h1>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">
            The problem solution employs three semaphores: one tracks the number of customers in the waiting room, excluding the one in the barber chair; the second signals whether the barber is idle or working; and the third provides mutual exclusion for the process execution.

            Customers monitor the waiting room occupancy. If it's full, the next customer exits the shop.

            The barber initially blocks on the "customers" semaphore. When a customer arrives, they acquire the mutex, ensuring exclusive access. If space is available, the customer sits, increments the waiting count, and wakes the barber if asleep.

            Once both barber and customer are awake, the haircut commences. Afterward, the customer exits, and if no others are waiting, the barber sleeps.
